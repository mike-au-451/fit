# Garmin FIT file tools (work in progress)

Read and dump a Garmin FIT file.

Format documentation is available at https://developer.garmin.com/fit/protocol/

## Why

My Wahoo device routinely tells me I'm running about off the coast of Africa (no doubt around 0, 0 lat/long) and fails to load maps.
I want to pull the raw data off the device and convert it to something useful like kml.

Right now this is a very sketchy outline for exploring the FIT files, but it can read all the files I care about.
